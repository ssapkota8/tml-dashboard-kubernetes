Real-time ML Dashboard with Docker &amp; Kubernetes | CSP450 Project
# CSP450 Project 3 – Real-Time ML Dashboard with Docker & Kubernetes :

This project was completed as part of the **Computer Systems Project (CSP450)** course at **Seneca College**.

## 📌 Overview

I customized and deployed a real-time **Transactional Machine Learning (TML)** dashboard using:

- 🐳 Docker (custom container)
- ☸️ Kubernetes (Minikube cluster)
- 📊 Python + TML Dashboard
- 🧠 Preprocessing types: `MIN, MAX, COUNT, VARIANCE, OUTLIERS, ANOMPROB`

## ⚙️ Project Tasks

- Modified Docker container and rebuilt with new preprocessing logic
- Pushed the image to [DockerHub]((https://hub.docker.com/repositories/ssapkota8))
- Deployed in a Minikube Kubernetes cluster
- Accessed the TML dashboard via port forwarding (localhost:9005)

## 📷 Screenshots

- TML Dashboard with preprocessing ✔️
- Kubernetes pod deployment ✔️
- Inside container using tmux ✔️

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Cloud-native development using Docker and Kubernetes
- Importance of preprocessing in ML workflows
- Working with real-time data visualization
